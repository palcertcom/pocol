# Local security checks

Run from the repository root. These tests use disposable local state and public
synthetic data. They do not call the live PoCol network or use an existing wallet.

```bash
php deploy/websites/tests/api_security.php
PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE=/path/to/playwright/index.mjs \
  POCOL_CHROMIUM=/path/to/chromium node deploy/websites/tests/browser_security.mjs
```

The PHP test needs PHP 8, curl and POSIX functions on Linux. Its 41 checks exercise
the actual request/response validators, pinned summary identity/branch consistency,
exact reward arithmetic and private cache/lock handling with injectable transports.
It does not start a PHP web server or validate the production host configuration.

The browser test needs Playwright (tested with 1.62.1) and an installed Chromium
(tested with 155.0.8059.79). It serves the four website roots on loopback only,
aborts HTTP requests outside each test origin, closes WebSockets, and checks that
no service worker was registered. It compiles with the existing IDE's bundled
Solidity 0.8.38, refuses a remote Solidity import, then deploys and calls a simple
contract in the existing browser worker's local Ethereum simulation. No compiler
or generated website bundle is modified. `POCOL_CHROMIUM` defaults to the system
Chromium path `/usr/bin/chromium`.

These 20 browser checks use no browser extension. They do not establish extension
viewer isolation, signing authorization, production HTTP headers, compatibility on
other browsers or equivalence between this local EVM and PoCol consensus.
